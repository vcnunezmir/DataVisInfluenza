The first 50 lines of our code contain the d3, topojson, and bootstrap libraries. topojson is used for the map graph, and bootstrap for the final, website look. Everything else is our code.

Interactivity:
Mouseover map to see state and count, mouseover line graph to see date, click bars to filter by strain.
